Happy Sunday! There is less than two weeks left of my academic career. That is too crazy for me to comprehend...

###### What did I do this week?

This week my groupp had our final IDB project due. It was pretty stressful, as were the other two projects for this website. We got all of the work done (we think!) and are very condfident with our final product. I learned an unbelievable amount over an array of topics and I am very grateful for it.

###### What's in my way?

At this point, not much. I've got two exams next week that I started studying for today and that is pretty much it. There are some small other tasks I have to do to prepare for graduation but not too much overall.

###### What will I do this week?

This week, my main task is to study for my two midterm exams next Thursday (Theory of Computation and this course). I don't have any finals so this is it as far as school goes for me! One final effort! In addition, I am best man at my friend's wedding this Friday...so I need to write a speech for him. Thanksgiving week is this week also and it'll be great to spend quality time with my family.

Most of us have had to switch over from swiping our debit and credit cards to inserting them into the chip readers. Although it is a small change, it had been a hot topic for small talk everywhere. Fortunately, all of the hassle and small talk has been worth it: the EMV chip has supposedly [reduced credit card](https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/f26d005d1da6fd71c343c11f6b06e542.htm) fraud by 18%. This is done by [authentification and making duplication of the card nearly impossible](http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/10/heres_why_credit_and_debit_car.html). So, next time you get frustrated at the chip reader for being so slow and beeping loudly, just remember the benefits.
