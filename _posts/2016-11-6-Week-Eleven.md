title: Weekly Blog, Nov 6
---

This is my first blog post. Initially, various forces combined to result in me not having the desire to do the blog post. As the semester comes to a close, I figured that I need to try to scrape together any points possible at the very end. “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb.

###### What did I do this week?

This week my group and I rushed to finish the second phase of the IDB project. We got everything *mostly* finished...amazingly. I found myself working nearly around the clock to get the website as good as possible. I was mostly in charge of building the database and models and the back end routes that feed a JSON file to the front end. I am also the *manager* of the group, so I make sure that everybody is doing what needs to be done for us to pass.

###### What is in my way?

Currently, the only things that is in my way is time...I would love to have 3 weeks to do this last phase of the project but I don't. It doesn't help that as the semester is wrapping up and graduation nears there is more and more to do every day. 

###### What will I do next week?

Next week and the week after I will be working hard to finish our IDB project. This phase doesn't appear to be as challenging as the last phase. Unfortunately, I said that about the phase before and was definitely proven wrong.

###### My experience

Overall, this course has been very challenging to me. I don't possess the same coding prowess that the other students possess. Going into the class, I had no experience in front-end development or building a website. As a result, I have learned a whole lot about a lot of different subjects. 

I worked an internship doing software consulting this summer where I did agile development with scrum meetings and even used slack. This class does an excellent job of mimicking the real-life, real_world software development process. I wouldn't be aware of it now had I not worked the internship but, looking back, taking this class BEFORE having a real world job would've been incredibly helpful for my experience this summer. Regardless, I have learned an incredible amount in this class and am very thankful for having taking it. 

###### Learn from my mistakes

One thing that I really learned the hard way this week is to always make sure your code compiles/runs/does not make backward progress before pushing for your teammates to use. At least once during the last phase of the project somebody would yell, "CHRIS THE CODE YOU PUSHED DOESN'T COMPILE!!". Especially during crunch time approaching a hard deadline, this can be incredibly stressful when you push code that doesn't work. Please, learn from my mistake: your coworkers will hate you if your code doesn't compile if there's a deadline approaching.
