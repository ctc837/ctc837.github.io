Happy Saturday! Today is the day of my brother's wedding, which is very exciting! However, it doesn't change the fact that I have a lot of work that I have to do this week, so I need to get some homework in whenever I have time.

###### What did I do this week?

This week, my group and I started planning and began working on the last phase of the project. This phase our main focuses are implementing a search functionality and using another group's API in our project. Both of these seem very doable. We also need to put together a presentation and give critiques over our's and the other group's website. In this past week I fixed any database/back-end related issues that caused us problems in the last phase. I also implemented a very basic search algorithm that the front-end developers can work with.

###### What is in my way?

Like last week, my main roadblock is not having enough time to complete what needs to be done. I think the same applies to my team members; we all have so much going on that it is really tough to find enough time to devote to all of it. This week will be stressful because of other projects/midterms in addition to finishing our website, but that is why I am starting early!

###### What will I get done this week?

Hopefully, this week my group and I will finish our IDB. It seems very doable to get this done...but again, that is what I said last phase too. School is wrapping up very fast! 

There have undoubtably been challenges working in a team of 5 that emulate the real world. Hearing back from everybody, getting prompt updates, and calming nerves have all been challenges that we, and every group, likely have. Team work is a constant in the world of programming so having the stressors and benefits of this in a class has been very beneficial.

As we all approach graduation we find that there are an incredibly large amount of paths that we can take moving forward. Most of us have an idea of what we want to do but some may have no idea. One path that you may not have known about is [Patent Law](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patent-bar-exam/category-b/). As it shows in the article, only people with Science Degrees can become and Intellectual Property (IP) lawyer. There is a large market for IP lawyers so they can find themselves working in any sector of the science world. Just one more door that you can choose to open!
