title: Weekly Blog, Nov 6

This is my first blog post. Initially, various forces combined to result in me not doing any blog posts. I continued to overlook the blog posts all semester. All of this was a mistake. DO THE BLOG POSTS. I will be doing posts for the rest of the semester (a whopping 3 weeks). “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb.

###### What did I do this week?
